A multi-class classification supervised learning model has been built to predict product category (prodcat1) a customer is likely to order

## Introduction
In this work, a multi-class classification supervised learning model has been built to predict product category (prodcat1) a customer is likely to order. This notebook can be broken down into the following sections:

- <b>Exploratory data analysis</b>: handle missing values; gain insights; propose customer segmentation idea
- <b>Feature engineering and feature selection</b>: compute aggregated features; visualize features correlation; rank feature importance and select features with most predictive power.
- <b>Data preparation and sampling</b>: randomly sample a smaller dataset to speed up training and test process; prepare the data for traditional ML inputs and neural network inputs.
- <b>Modeling</b>: random forest model; GBDT; neural network with embedding layer
- <b>Summary</b>: model comparison and improvements to be done.
